# Pymaceuticals Data Analysis Project Summary #
# Overview #
In this project, I took on the role of a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., to analyze clinical trial data for potential anti-cancer treatments. Using Python and Matplotlib, I focused on examining the efficacy of the drug Capomulin in comparison to other treatment regimens.

# Accomplishments #
## Data Preparation and Cleaning ##
- Successfully merged key datasets to form a comprehensive DataFrame for analysis.
- Identified and removed duplicate entries, ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis.
- Updated the DataFrame to reflect the removal of duplicates, thus providing a reliable basis for further analysis.
## Statistical Analysis ##
- Generated a detailed summary statistics table that included mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volumes for each drug regimen.
- Ensured comprehensive coverage of key statistical measures to accurately represent the data.
## Visual Data Representation ##
- Developed bar charts using both Pandas and Matplotlib to depict the number of measurements for each drug regimen.
- Created pie charts to illustrate the gender distribution of the mice involved in the study.
## Advanced Data Analysis ##
- Calculated the final tumor volumes for mice treated with four major drug regimens, including Capomulin.
- Conducted a rigorous quartile and IQR analysis to identify potential outliers.
- Created a combined box plot highlighting the distribution of final tumor volumes, with a focus on potential outliers.
## Detailed Line and Scatter Plots ##
- Produced a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a selected mouse treated with Capomulin.
- Generated a scatter plot to explore the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen.
## Correlation and Regression Analysis ##
- Calculated the correlation coefficient and performed a linear regression analysis between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
- Visualized the linear regression model on the scatter plot, providing a clear representation of the correlation.
## Project Management and Reporting ##
- Effectively managed project files and documentation in a dedicated GitHub repository ('pandas-challenge').
- Prepared thorough visualizations and analysis reports for assisting the executive team in decision-making.
